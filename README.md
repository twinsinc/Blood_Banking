# Blood Banking
The second homework for the JSCC18 at Women Techmakers Berlin.
This is a prototype of a blood banking system that contains information about donors and recipients in various blood donation centers. We can add donors as well as recipients to the system. All of them have a blood type which is a very important parameter. With help of this application we can see who needs blood and of which type and who donates a blood type that we need. Every Blood Bank has a name, location and a telephone number.
